# DillyDaily

TODO (ongoing) :

- change "Home" for "My recipes" (interface to edit and write recipes)
- flesh out the "+" button in groceries page

TODO (at some point) :

- write in the personnalisation file instead of modifying the lists (so that it stays across reloads)
- work on the server
- "download" recipes added to meal plan (aka write them in a file)
- create an interface to write in recipes from the app
- personalized baseline grocery list
